Linga Bhairavi has all the first 3 and half chakras, so it is a complete woman

These were translated by Isha {
   Muladhara: The foundation chakra :: Influences one's health, well being, and gives a sense of stability and completness
   Swadhisthana: The abode of the self :: Offers possibilities ranging from procreation to creating devine entities
   Manipuraka: The maintenance center :: Maintains the conjunction of the 72.000 nadis, enhances one's hability to act in the world
   Anahata: The Unstruck sound :: Diving into an ocean of compassion, not love

   Note: these descriptions were given when talking about Linga Bhairavi, so I am not sure if the half chakra Anahata that Linga Bhairavi has it a translation missing the full scope of anahata. Maybe this translation includes only half chakra too
