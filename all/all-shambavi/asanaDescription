The word “Shambhavi” in Sanskrit means “Lord Shiva’s Beloved”. According to Hindu legends, Shambhavi is one of the many names of Lord Shiva’s consort Parvati. It’s believed when Parvati asked Shiva about enlightenment and various yogic practices that can lead one to higher states of consciousness, he taught her the technique of Shambhavi Mudra.


The complete process of Shambhavi Mahamudra involves a few steps prior to the actual kriya. Below is the procedure in short:

Begin the practice with 3 preparatory asanas; Patangasna (butterfly pose), Shishupalasna (rock the baby pose) and NadiVibajan (cat stretch). All 3 asanas are performed gently in 5 minute-period.     
Now sit cross-legged in Siddhasana or accomplished pose and do Sukha Kriya or Nadi Shodhana Pranayama for 6 to 7 minutes. 
Then loudly chant AUM 21 times with long deep breathing and hands in Gyan mudra. 
Next, do fast-paced Bhastrika pranayama or Fluttering of Breath for 3 to 4 minutes.
Perform Kumbhaka (breath retention) at the end of Fluttering Breath and engage three bandhas one by one; first Mula bandha (pelvic floor), then uddiyana bandha (lower abdomen) and finally throat lock (Jalandhar bandha).
Keeping your bandhas engaged, slightly upturn your head, close your eyes and focus on the space between eyebrows – As we do in basic Shambhavi Mudra with open eyes. It’s the actual kriya. 
End the practice with 5-minute of Vipassana meditation. Focus your awareness on the present moment and watch your breath. 
Be in the above meditative posture for a few minutes and then slowly open your eyes
